# Simple Storage Hardhat Project (For Learning)

This project is me trying to understand how the hardhat framework works. It's just a simple storage contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
